Enterprise DevSecOps Pipeline with Automated Security & Compliance

Overview

This project implements a CI/CD security pipeline that integrates SAST, DAST, container security, AI-driven anomaly detection, and API security testing to automate vulnerability identification and prioritization. Additionally, it enforces cloud and Kubernetes security policies while maintaining compliance through real-time monitoring and automation.

Key Features

CI/CD Security Pipeline

Integrated SonarQube (SAST), OWASP ZAP (DAST), and Trivy (Container Security) for automated vulnerability detection.

Implemented GitHub Actions to enforce security checks at every stage of the pipeline.

AI-Driven Anomaly Detection

Developed a machine learning model to analyze security reports and prioritize high-risk vulnerabilities.

Utilized Scikit-learn to train on historical security data.

API Security & Secret Scanning

Integrated GitLeaks for secrets detection.

Automated API security testing using Postman/Newman.

Cloud & Kubernetes Security Enforcement

Enforced Kyverno/OPA Admission Controller policies to block insecure container deployments.

Integrated AWS Security Hub & AWS Config for compliance checks and misconfiguration detection.

Real-Time Security Monitoring & Reporting

Built a Grafana security dashboard using Prometheus to visualize vulnerability trends.

Integrated logs from SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, and Trivy for real-time monitoring.

AWS account with Security Hub enabled

SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, and Trivy installed

Steps

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/enterprise-devsecops-pipeline.git
cd enterprise-devsecops-pipeline

Set up GitHub Actions workflow with necessary credentials.

Deploy security scanning tools:

docker-compose up -d sonarqube zap trivy

Run AI-driven security analysis:

python ai_security_analyzer.py

Deploy monitoring stack (Grafana + Prometheus):

kubectl apply -f monitoring-stack.yaml

Verify security reports in Grafana dashboard.
